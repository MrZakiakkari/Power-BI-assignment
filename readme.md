# Exploratory Data Visualisations using Power BI

## Task:
You are to use Power BI to create a Report and Dashboard allowing for Exploratory data visualisations.  

The data you will need is the Covid Virus spread, and the vaccination data, available at https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations. ;   The data of interest is the history of the pattern of the virus  and vaccinations in Ireland compared to rest of Europe only.  

The dashboard should be designed to be read on a mobile phone device.  
 
The report should allow drill down, filtering, and tool tips so that data points can be individually explored.  The report should contain one page that provides Ireland's statistics, and at least one page that compares Ireland to the rest of Europe.    You may decide to have different pages for the vaccinations and for the virus spread.  

The drill down feature, should uses simple tiles with an overall number, and using a variety of different charts show the comparisons with other states.   The reader should be provided with tool tips, similar to the picture attached, and available at the at the https://ourworldindata.org/covid-vaccinations page.  

Your target reader is the general public, so text should be provided that provides some explanation of the data.  

## Submission:
Please ensure that your reports and dashboards are labelled using your name, e.g. myname.pbix .  This enables me to correctly identify the individual student's work.

You should submit the report in .PBIX format (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/create-reports/service-export-to-pbix if you need guidance) to the Moodle page.

You should also share the Mobile Phone format Dashboard to jacqueline.humphries@lit.ie (see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/collaborate-share/service-how-to-collaborate-distribute-dashboards-reports for more details)

## Grading:-
Grades will be awarded for the correct submissions, a variety of interesting charts, chart design, report and dashboard design, drill down and exploration features.

I've attached a rubric that provides some guidance as to the marking scheme.
